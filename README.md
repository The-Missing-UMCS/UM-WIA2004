# WIA2004 (Operating System)

Welcome to the WIA2004 (Operating System) Github repository.

WIA2004 is offered by the [**Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT)**](http://www.fsktm.um.edu.my/) at the  [**Universiti Malaya (UM)**](https://www.um.edu.my/) in Malaysia. This repository provides solutions implemented in different programming languages to lab questions. Currently the Java and the Python version are completed. However, in the future, this repository is going to offer implementations Golang, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, C and C++ version.

To get started, feel free to browse through the materials and use them to supplement your learning. Hopefully that you find this repository to be helpful and informative. If you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

## Why This Repository Exists  

As part of the **[The-Missing-UMCS](https://github.com/The-Missing-UMCS)** initiative, this repository serves as a valuable reference for students taking this course.  

Additionally, it aims to address a common problem:  
*"Which programming language should I use for the lab?"*  

Seniors had different answers—some used **Python**, others **Java**, and some preferred **C**—making it difficult to choose the right one.  

The solution? **Implement solutions in all popular programming languages.**  

This approach not only eliminates uncertainty but also provides a unique learning opportunity. By exploring multiple languages and paradigms beyond Java and OOP, I can broaden my skills and become a more versatile developer.

## Why You Should Star This Repository  

If you're taking **UMWIA2004**, here are five compelling reasons to star this repository and use it as a study aid:  

1. **Multi-Language Implementations**  
   This repository provides lab solutions in multiple programming languages, eliminating the dilemma of choosing the right one.  

2. **Easy to Run**  
   All code is written using JetBrains products like **IntelliJ for Java** and **PyCharm for Python**. Once dependencies are set up, the code runs smoothly.  

3. **Well-Documented and Readable**  
   Every piece of code is properly documented and commented, making it easy to understand and follow.  

4. **High-Quality Code**  
   The Java implementations strictly follow **[SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)** and apply industry-standard design patterns like the **Strategy Pattern**.  

5. **Realistic OS Simulation**  
   The code extensively incorporates domain-specific terminologies such as **Virtual Memory Manager, Main Memory, and Virtual Page Number (VPN)** to simulate real OS operations as accurately as possible. Studying these implementations will enhance your understanding of how operating systems function.
